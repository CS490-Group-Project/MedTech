# CS 490 Group Project

## Title of our app: MedTech

### Description:
The purpose of our app is to help educate users on how to properly handle a medical emergency if/when one occurs. It will contain information about various emergencies, prevention tips, how to spot early symptoms etc. Furthermore, it will focus on how to react to a current emergency, guiding a user through the necessary steps. For example, after confirming that an emergency is a heart attack, the application would provide step by step instructions on what to do. It will also include a button to quickly call authorities and will contain any helpful tips, videos, gifs, music, etc. to best guide the user.
